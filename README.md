This project implements the game of Breakout.

Name: Thomas Owens

### Timeline

Start Date: 1/13/2020

Finish Date: 1/19/2020

Hours Spent: 15

### Resources Used

StackOverflow for JavaFX features and bugs, along with the provided JavaFX resources.

### Running the Program

Main class: 
Main.java

Data files needed: 
ALL brick images, in /resources
ANY/ALL level#layout.txt files desired

Key/Mouse inputs:
SPACE BAR navigates the menu screens.
LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys move the paddle left and right.

Cheat keys:
S destroys a random alien ship.
B switches control to the ball instead of the paddle.
L adds a life to the player.
< and > decrease or increase the size of the ball, respectively.
R resets the ball and paddle.
1-6 switch directly to levels 1-6 respectively.

Known Bugs:
The ball can become stuck on the side of the screen if it bounces off the corner of the paddle too near the edge.
After using cheat keys to change the size of the ball or control its movement, it may not bounce off the paddle again.

Extra credit:
I added an alien "mothership" in the last level as a boss, which will spawn new alien ships until it dies.

### Notes/Assumptions
To my knowledge, no assumptions were made about the requirements of the project.

### Impressions
I liked the idea of this project, but I felt that the requirements were spread out and difficult to locate on the website, and therefore unclear.
